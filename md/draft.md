##How to convert text to html without knowing anything about html##

In this section we will introduce Markdown, a text-to-html converter that anyone can use with very little technical knowledge.  Not a techie?  Good.  You're in the right place.  This is the most important sentence you will read today: if you can spell, you can build a website.

Now, you may not even know exactly what html is, so before we get there, think about Markdown as a way to format text.  You can use Markdown to make text bold, italicized, a numbered list, whatever you want.  So let's start there.

First of all, You are probably wondering about the hashtags surrounding the text at the top of the page.  Good.  Wondering about them is the first step toward success, and the fact that you noticed them means you're on the right track.

If this were written in Markdown, you wouldn't see the hashtags.  Instead, the text between the hashtags would be larger.  That's what those hashtags do: make the text inside them larger.  One hashtag on each side of the text indicates a first-order header, two hashtags, a second-order header, etc.

If we wished to emphasize a word, we'd use asterisks or underscores: one for *italics*, two for **bold**.  Likewise, _italics_, or __bold__.  Same thing.  As far as Markdown is concerned, asterisks and underscores to the same thing, so let's stick with asterisks.

This is just an introduction, so don't worry if it's a little bit confusing.  The point is that this is what the text would look like before Markdown translates it.

In Markdown, you type your text in the Markdown window pane, and your syntax determines how it will appear in the final product.  So if you're in the Markdown pane and you type:

<pre>*this sentence is italicized*</pre>

<p>
  What will show up on the website will look like this:
</p>

<p>
  <i>this sentence is italicized</i>
</p>
